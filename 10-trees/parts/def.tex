  \begin{theorem}
    Let $T$ be an undirected graph with $n$ vertices. \\[3pt]
    Then the following statements are \red{equivalent}:
    \begin{enumerate}[(1)]
      \setlength{\itemsep}{6pt}
      \item $T$ is a tree;
      \item $T$ is acyclic, and has $n-1$ edges;
      \item $T$ is connected, and has $n-1$ edges;
      \item $T$ is connected, and each edge is a \cyan{bridge};
      \item Any two vertices of $T$ are connected by exactly one path;
      \item $T$ is acyclic, but the addition of any edge creates exactly one cycle.
